					<h1>Life and Journey</h1>
					<p>
						It may be that when we no longer know which way to go that we have come to our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home,a journey is a gesture inscribed in space, it vanishes even as itâ€™s made. You go from one place to another place, and on to somewhere else again, and already behind you there is no trace that you were ever there.

	<h1>MOM-An Angle</h1>
	<p>Always remember, wherever you are, whether near or far, you had a mother who really, really loved you. The original mother. Once you've found your true inner guru you can never again be divided. Perfect union with the divine, through the grace of your real teacher, transcends time, space, death and all worldly limitations. Your real teacher is the original mother - regardless in which manifest or non-manifest form, or gender, she appears. The one who nurtures you and the one who also, out of wisdom and compassion, corrects you if you are misguided.</p>

	<h1>Joyful Friendship</h1>
	<p>I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. A good friend is like a four-leaf clover: hard to find and lucky to have. There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. There's nothing like a really loyal, dependable, good friend</p>
